<!-- This is a simple HTML page that celebrates friendship with a modern design. 
     It includes a header, two friend cards, and a footer. The design is responsive 
     and uses CSS animations for a smooth user experience. -->
<!-- The page is styled with a gradient background, custom fonts, and hover effects
      on the friend cards. The content is centered and adapts to different screen sizes. 
      The header includes a title and a subtitle, while each friend card has a name 
      and a short description. The footer contains a simple message about friendship. -->
<!-- The page is designed to be visually appealing and easy to read, with a focus on
      the theme of friendship. The use of animations and hover effects adds a modern touch 
      to the overall design. The layout is clean and organized, making it easy for users 
      to navigate and enjoy the content. -->
<!-- The HTML structure is semantic, with appropriate use of header, main, section, and footer
      elements. This enhances accessibility and SEO, ensuring that the content is easily 
      understood by both users and search engines. The use of external fonts from Google Fonts 
      adds a unique touch to the typography, making it stand out. -->
<!-- The CSS styles are well-organized and use variables for colors and fonts, allowing for easy
      customization and maintenance. The use of media queries ensures that the design is responsive 
      and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. The overall design 
      is modern, clean, and visually appealing, making it a great representation of friendship. -->
<!-- The page is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to change the content, colors,
      and styles to suit their preferences. This makes it a versatile template for anyone looking 
      to create a friendship-themed webpage. The use of comments throughout the code provides 
      additional context and explanations, making it easy for developers to understand and modify 
      the code as needed. -->
<!-- The page is a great starting point for anyone looking to create a personal website,
      a portfolio, or a blog. The design is simple yet effective, allowing users to focus on the 
      content while still providing a visually appealing experience. The use of modern web design 
      techniques ensures that the page is fast, responsive, and user-friendly, making it a great 
      choice for anyone looking to showcase their work or share their thoughts with the world. -->
<!-- The page is also a great example of how to use HTML and CSS together to create a cohesive
      and visually appealing design. The use of semantic HTML elements helps to structure the content 
      in a meaningful way, while the CSS styles provide the visual flair that makes the page stand out. 
      This combination of HTML and CSS is a fundamental aspect of modern web development, and this page 
      serves as a great example of how to implement these techniques effectively. -->
<!-- The page is designed to be easily shareable, allowing users to spread the message of friendship
      and connect with others. The use of social media icons or links could be added to the footer 
      to encourage sharing and engagement. This would enhance the overall experience and allow users 
      to connect with friends and family through the page. The design is flexible enough to accommodate 
      these additions without compromising the overall aesthetic. -->
